This folder contains our code and supplementary files for the Mini Project.

mini_project.py is the python code that interfaces with the camera to detect the aruco marker's position and communicate it to the arduino. It also prints the goal position to an LCD screen.

mini_project.ino is the arduino code that uses the information provided by the pi to move the wheels to the correct position.

Runmotorcontrol.m and motorsim.slx are supplementary files that were used for testing.

This folder contains our code and supplementary files for the Demo 1 Project.

Demo1.py is the python code that interfaces with the camera to detect the center of a Aruco marker and find the angle that it makes with the center of the attached camera. It prints this angle on an LCD screen. 
This code was written by Jamie Vendryes and Cooper Phillips. 

demo1.ino is the arduino code that has the robot rotate to a certain angle then move forward a specific distance with implemented control systems.
This code was written by Braden Guthrie and Noe Avila.
